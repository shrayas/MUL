{"name":"MUL","body":"### Motivation\r\nSo, i read manga, a lot. But i'm too bored to be going to places like twitter / mangastream / mangareader once in a week to check if the mangas i follow have been released. Also, if i'm in my _zone_ (TM @holman), i hate it even more. The terminal is my lair and i like to live there. \r\n\r\nBut i like mangas too, they give me a much needed diversion. SO put both the hands together and we got *MUL* :]","tagline":"the manga tracker for geeks","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
